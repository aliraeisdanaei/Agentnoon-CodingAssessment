# Agentnoon Coding Assessment

## What I did
* Backend API that reads the csv file provided and calculates the recursive values
* Backend Testing of the recursive calculations (this took me a long time because I actually wrote the test cases)
* Backend Testing of the API routes

* Vue Front End that draws a tree

    * Front End can navigate the employee tree up and down

I wanted to deploy my frontend and backend so that you could see it, but I really wanted to give you my proud results as soon as possible. 

## How to Run
### API
```
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt # there aren't many requirements, but you might want to set up a venv
python run.py
```

### Testing API
```
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest
pytest
```

### frontend
